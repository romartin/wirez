    - Sequence flows stuff

    - Known issues
        
        - Canvas loading related issues
            - loading box -> does not appear when loading a diagram or adding a shape from palette ( it should appear )
            - load & draw diagram - too much loading time ( but not so much in production mode... )
    
        - Navigator 
            - clean when no session or session closed
            - Reduce size for preview
            - Context2D proxy ( Mark ) 
        
        - Toolbox
            - Moving parent diagram -> toolboxes bad coordinates
            - Remove toolbox icons when shape deleted from canvas
            - Icons are wires shapes and when dragging the main shape the docking fires
            
        - Palette
            - add connection toolbox command -> click on diagram as target node -> exception thrown 
            - bounds indexer - graph vs canvas & fixings ( builders & drag proxies )
            - onclick -> add node in same parent, no need to drag...
        
        - CDI scopes
            - Review cdi scopes for model & graph factories, adatpers, etc - reduce #instances on heap

    - Fix wires issues
        - WiresLayoutContainer - Refactor this stuff, resizing does not works good
            - Examples
                - Resize -> http://screencast.com/t/TjRkYpMvt
                - Align -> http://screencast.com/t/62lCjZGYDq7i
        - WiresManager 
            - addToIndex not working for "unconnected" connectors
            - do not add to index by default, let the developer choose
        - Wires Events
            - More events and provide the native events and contexts as well...
            - Drag event -> cannot get the DragContext
            - In general -> return the handler registration as well in order to remove handlers when no necessary.
        - Remove WiresMananger member from WiresShape/Connector classes
        
        
        
        - Mediators broke Connectors & shape toolbox, if any
            - Both zoom ( zoom + move shape ) and pam ( pam + redraw ) brokes connectors
                    -> all I know is if i set the scale or rotate manually on the viewport
                               the connectors are not in the correct place
                               panel.getViewport().setTransform( new Transform().scale(1.5, 1.5).translate(-75, -75));
                               that breaks the connector
                               which means it'll also break alignment
                               yeah alignment is off too
                               and so is drag, when you release. it jumps
                               there must be a way to get a viewport x/y offset
                               rather than calculate it every single time
                    -> see mediators_issues.txt

        - WiresConnector
            - Decorators can be null
            - animate rotations both clockwise ( svg only supports single wise )
            - 
    - Performance issues on class Geometry
    - External configs -> Connectors / docking hotspot size
    - When dragging parent shapes, the connectors on the children are not drag
    - Shape order ( flows, parent/child nodes, etc )
    - review wires containment. 
        - Eg: lanes -> if dragging lane title inside the lane, the lane gets removed from the parent diagram and then it sometimes gets on top and nothing can be moved inside it.
        
    - Wires refactors
        - Exctract logics for containment & connection ( highlight parents, show magnets, etc) from drag event handlers
        
    - Others
        - Text orientation
    
    - Mobile
        - Pan & zoom mediators for mobile touch events
        - Other touch handlers required for desginer

        - SelectionControl
            - Select multiple

- API
*****

    - model
        - Definition Impls -> finish implementation & generate from ifaces and the adapter as well
        - Performance
            - private constructors
            - review inmutability (final fields) -> bindable needs pub no-arg const! How 2 deal with finals?
            - if making fields static -> marhsalls as null... ( eg: DefSet#labels )
            - builders
                - mark as @NonPortable
                - auto generate when using annotated models?
        - avoid @Portable and @Bindable and generate the Errai.properties for the annotated pojos.
    
    - Reverse containment
        - Eg: Adding a Lane over some other elements
        - Grouping ( selecting the shapes in an area of the layer )
        
    - Definitions "sub-sets"

        - only affect to the palette's?
        - restrict elements & properties

    - Graph Processors - declare as @Remote ifaces

    - Commands
        - UNDO's
            - ClearGraph
        - Fix -> both SetConnectionSourceNodeCommand/Target commands are checking rules using same arguments...
        - ensure only single parent/edge connections between nodes
         - CommManager
            - executions async ( use of Caller's ) - use callbacks as expensive ops can be executed on backend asynchronously
        - Restore the graph to a previous state
        - REDO's

    - Look-ups
        - Add cache
        - Use Caller's on client side
        - Use Dashbuilder's DataSets?
        
Annotation processors
*********************

    - Check that each annotation is present on expected domain model class

Backend
*******

    - Missing diagram services ( such as delete )
        - diagrams sync / commands sync between client & tenant managers on server side

Import tool
************

  - refactor to current API
  - typesafe velocity templates? 
  - TemplateResult 
    - add skipped results ( pojos + message )
  - generated files indentation

Performance
***********


    - Memory
        - Events
            -. Use uuid's instead of shapes/elements/etc? avoid using shared instances
        - Commands & Violations
            - Clonse shapes/elements/etc arguments? avoid using shared instances
        - Managers & registries
            - Definition
        
    - Processing
        - Graph indexer/incremental?
        - Bounds indexer
    
    - Session widgets
        - Checks session events are handled as expected
        
    - TreeExplorer 
        - redraw only updated element & children, if any.

    - Navigator & card
        - improve performance by only processing and adding into the DOM tree the current card side.
        
    - Load diagram
        - Slow - Heap & cpu performance check

    - Custom Map impl for storing DefSet stuff ( valid to use on bindable adapters, indexes, etc )
    
    - Client
        - CanvasHandler & handleZIndex
            - Really need of ShapeView#ZIndex? or exist a problem on traverse processor while drawing ( bad order )?
        
House keeping & others
**********************
    
    - recompiling canvas controls forces to restart server always? ( csadilek )
    - Unit testing
    - Distros
        - remove beans.xml exclusion for org.wirez.client... should not be there. 
    - Remove GraphBoundsIndexBuilder and use Layer#findShapeAt ( check Builder control & GraphBoundsIndexer & LienzoLayerUtils )
    - BPMN marshalling / unmarshalling
        - Remove code from "legacy" package and use the jbpm-designer-backend artifact as a required dependency.
            - Exclude drools datamodeller transitive artifact -> It produces an errai compilation error
            - Try to exclude as much as possible the transitive dependencies
            - Currently some CDI issues appears when adding it...
     - Connections
        - Do not call head/tailConnectionAccepted until drag eng!
